# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

## Week_01: Introductory Concepts

### Introduction
- Data structure is the most fundamental building block concept in computer science.
- Algorithm is a different but highly related concept.
- Therefore, good knowledge of data structures and algorithms used to manipulate them is very important to build efficient software.

### Outcomes:

### Definitions:
- **Data type** is defined by the value it can take and the operations that can be done on it.
- **Data Structures** is a logical or mathematical model of a particular organization or data.
- **Data Structures** can also be seen as a way of storing and organizing data in computer memory.

### Types of Data Structure:
- **Linear Data Structures** are those in which data are stored and accessed in a **_sequential_** manner. **Order of the data stored is preserved** meaning each element has a _predecessor_ and a _successor_ except the first and the last element which only have respectively a successor and a predecessor.
- **Non-linear Data Structures** are those in which data are stored and accessed in a **_non-sequential_** manner based on certain relationships and property among them. More details about those relationship will be discussed in this notebook.
